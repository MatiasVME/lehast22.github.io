# GodotTutorialDatabase
A collection of all tutorials for the Godot game engine

Each row in the table starts with a "Category" that describes the main point of the tutorial. The second column is simply the tutorial link which is followed by the author of the tutorial. The "Notes" column describes the additional ideas that are discussed in the tutorial. At the bottom of the "Category" column there is a dropdown menu that lets you filter by categories. The search bar searches all three columns.

***This is a work in progress. If you feel a tutorial has been misrepresented or want a specific tutorial is missing, feel free to contact me on through Godot Discord Channel. Anyone is welcome to contact me for a pull request if they want to make changes to the database***
